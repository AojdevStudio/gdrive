## Dev Notes

### Epic Context
This is Story 3 of 3 in the GDRIVE-3 Encryption Key Rotation Epic. This story can only be started after Stories 1 and 2 are complete. It focuses on ensuring quality through testing and providing clear documentation for the new system.

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual component behavior
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify complete workflows work end-to-end
3. **Security Tests**: Validate cryptographic implementation
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure system meets performance targets

### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `src/__tests__/auth/`
- Integration tests: `src/__tests__/integration/`
- Security tests: `src/__tests__/security/`
- Performance tests: `src/__tests__/performance/`

### Test Coverage Requirements
```typescript
// KeyRotationManager.test.ts
describe('KeyRotationManager', () => {
  test('generates keys with proper entropy');
  test('derives keys using PBKDF2 with correct iterations');
  test('stores and retrieves keys correctly');
  test('enforces singleton pattern');
  test('handles concurrent rotation requests');
});

// TokenManager.test.ts  
describe('TokenManager (Versioned)', () => {
  test('encrypts tokens with version metadata');
  test('decrypts versioned tokens correctly');
  test('rejects tokens with invalid versions');
  test('performs within 5% of baseline performance');
  test('clears memory after operations');
});
```

### Documentation Structure

#### README.md Additions
```markdown
## Key Rotation

### Initial Migration (Required for Existing Installations)
Before upgrading to v2.0.0, migrate your existing tokens:

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Backup existing tokens (automatic, but manual backup recommended)
cp .gdrive-mcp-tokens.json .gdrive-mcp-tokens.backup.json

# 2. Run migration script
node scripts/migrate-tokens.js

# 3. Verify migration success
node dist/index.js verify-keys
\`\`\`

### Rotating Encryption Keys
\`\`\`bash
# Generate new key and re-encrypt all tokens
node dist/index.js rotate-key

# Verify all tokens work with new key
node dist/index.js verify-keys
\`\`\`

### Environment Variables
- `GDRIVE_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - Base64-encoded 32-byte key (auto-generated if not set)
- `GDRIVE_KEY_DERIVATION_ITERATIONS` - PBKDF2 iterations (default: 100000)
```

#### Operations Runbook
Location: `docs/Guides/07-key-rotation.md`

Content should include:
1. Routine key rotation procedures (quarterly)
2. Emergency key rotation process
3. Monitoring and alerting setup
4. Troubleshooting common issues
5. Security incident response

### Cleanup Checklist
Before marking this story complete, ensure:
- [ ] All legacy encryption code removed
- [ ] No backward compatibility remains
- [ ] All tests pass with > 90% coverage
- [ ] Documentation is accurate and complete
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME comments remain about legacy system

### Performance Targets
- Key rotation: < 30 seconds for 100 tokens
- PBKDF2 overhead: < 5% compared to static key
- Memory usage: No memory leaks during rotation
- Startup time: < 2 seconds with new system

### Dependencies on Other Stories
- Requires Story 1 (new versioned system) and Story 2 (migration tool) complete
- This is the final story - focuses on quality and documentation
