# GDRIVE-3 Encryption Key Rotation - Implementation Overview

**Issue:** GDRIVE-3  
**Title:** Implement encryption key rotation mechanism  
**Total Duration:** 4-5 days  
**Priority:** Critical Security Feature

## Overview

This implementation is divided into 4 phases, each building upon the previous one. Each phase has its own detailed checklist with specific tasks, testing requirements, and completion criteria.

## Implementation Phases

### ðŸ“‹ [Phase 1: Core Key Management Infrastructure](./GDRIVE-3-phase-1-core-infrastructure.md)
**Duration:** Days 1-2  
**Focus:** Build foundational key management system

Key deliverables:
- PBKDF2 key derivation system
- Versioned key storage
- KeyRotationManager implementation
- Security primitives (timing-safe compare, secure random)

### ðŸ“‹ [Phase 2: Token Migration System](./GDRIVE-3-phase-2-migration-system.md)
**Duration:** Days 2-3  
**Focus:** Integrate key rotation with existing token system

Key deliverables:
- Enhanced TokenManager with multi-version support
- Token migration logic
- Backward compatibility
- Atomic migration operations

### ðŸ“‹ [Phase 3: CLI Integration](./GDRIVE-3-phase-3-cli-integration.md)
**Duration:** Days 3-4  
**Focus:** User-facing commands and operations

Key deliverables:
- CLI commands (rotate-key, list-keys, verify-rotation)
- Interactive prompts and safety checks
- Progress indicators
- Dry-run mode

### ðŸ“‹ [Phase 4: Security Hardening](./GDRIVE-3-phase-4-security-hardening.md)
**Duration:** Days 4-5  
**Focus:** Advanced security and compliance features

Key deliverables:
- Timing attack prevention
- Secure memory clearing
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Compliance features

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Start with Phase 1** - No dependencies, establishes core infrastructure
2. **Complete each phase fully** before moving to the next
3. **Run tests** at the end of each phase
4. **Security review** after Phase 4 completion
