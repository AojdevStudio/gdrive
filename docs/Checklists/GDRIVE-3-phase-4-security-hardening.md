# Phase 4: Security Hardening

**Duration:** Days 4-5  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 Complete

## Overview

This phase adds critical security enhancements and compliance features. Focus on defense in depth, comprehensive audit logging, and protection against sophisticated attacks.

## Pre-Phase Checklist

- [ ] Review OWASP cryptographic guidelines
- [ ] Analyze potential attack vectors
- [ ] Review compliance requirements
- [ ] Plan security testing strategy

## Implementation Tasks

### Security Implementation

- [ ] Implement secure memory clearing in all crypto operations
- [ ] Add timing attack prevention for version detection
- [ ] Implement key derivation with configurable iteration counts
- [ ] Add entropy validation for generated keys
- [ ] Implement secure random number generation verification

### Audit System Enhancement

- [ ] Extend existing audit logging with key rotation events
- [ ] Add structured logging for all key operations
- [ ] Implement audit trail validation
- [ ] Add security event correlation capabilities

### Advanced Security Features

- [ ] Implement key escrow for compliance (if required)
- [ ] Add hardware security module (HSM) support hooks
- [ ] Implement key usage policies and restrictions
- [ ] Add automated security policy enforcement

### Compliance & Monitoring

- [ ] Add FIPS compliance mode (optional)
- [ ] Implement key rotation policy enforcement
- [ ] Add compliance reporting capabilities
- [ ] Create security metrics dashboard

## Testing Requirements

### Security Tests

- [ ] Test timing attack resistance
- [ ] Verify memory clearing effectiveness
- [ ] Test against known crypto vulnerabilities
- [ ] Validate entropy quality
- [ ] Test audit trail integrity

### Penetration Testing Prep

- [ ] Document security boundaries
- [ ] Prepare test environments
- [ ] Create security testing checklist
- [ ] Plan remediation process

## Documentation

- [ ] Create security architecture document
- [ ] Document threat model
- [ ] Write security operations guide
- [ ] Create incident response procedures

## Security Best Practices Validation

### Cryptographic Implementation
- [ ] Use only approved algorithms (AES-256-GCM)
- [ ] Proper IV/nonce generation and handling
- [ ] Secure key derivation (PBKDF2 100k+ iterations)
- [ ] Constant-time operations where needed

### Key Management
- [ ] Keys never logged or exposed
- [ ] Secure key storage with proper permissions
- [ ] Key rotation without service interruption
- [ ] Emergency key recovery procedures

### Error Handling
- [ ] No sensitive data in error messages
- [ ] Proper error logging without key material
- [ ] Graceful degradation under attack
- [ ] Rate limiting for key operations

## Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] All security tests passing
- [ ] Audit logging comprehensive
- [ ] No timing vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] Memory clearing verified
- [ ] Compliance requirements met
- [ ] Security review completed

## Final Deployment Readiness

- [ ] Production deployment guide created
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Team trained on operations
- [ ] Security contacts documented
