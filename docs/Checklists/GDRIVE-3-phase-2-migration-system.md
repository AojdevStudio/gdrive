# Phase 2: Token Migration System

**Duration:** Days 2-3  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 Complete

## Overview

This phase integrates the key management infrastructure into the existing TokenManager, enabling seamless token migration and backward compatibility. Focus on maintaining zero downtime during key rotation.

## Pre-Phase Checklist

- [ ] Verify Phase 1 infrastructure is complete and tested
- [ ] Review existing TokenManager implementation
- [ ] Plan migration strategy for existing tokens
- [ ] Identify potential failure scenarios

## Implementation Tasks

### Backend Development - TokenManager Enhancement

- [ ] Modify `src/auth/TokenManager.ts` to support versioned keys
  - [ ] Update `encrypt()` method to use current key version
  - [ ] Update `decrypt()` method to auto-detect token version
  - [ ] Add `migrateTokensToNewKey(oldVersion: string, newVersion: string): Promise<void>`
  - [ ] Implement fallback chain for multiple key versions
  - [ ] Add token format validation for different versions

### Backend Development - Migration Logic

- [ ] Create token re-encryption process
- [ ] Implement batch processing for large token volumes
- [ ] Add progress tracking for migration operations
- [ ] Add rollback capability for failed migrations
- [ ] Implement atomic operations for token updates

### Integration with KeyRotationManager

- [ ] Connect TokenManager to KeyRotationManager
- [ ] Implement key version lookup during decryption
- [ ] Add automatic key selection for encryption
- [ ] Create migration coordinator service

## Testing Requirements

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test encryption with new key version
- [ ] Test decryption of legacy tokens
- [ ] Test mixed version token handling
- [ ] Test batch migration process
- [ ] Test migration rollback scenarios
- [ ] Test concurrent access during migration

### Performance Tests

- [ ] Measure migration speed for various token volumes
- [ ] Test memory usage during batch operations
- [ ] Verify no performance degradation for normal operations

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Ensure old tokens remain accessible during migration
- [ ] Implement secure cleanup of decrypted data
- [ ] Add audit logging for all migration operations
- [ ] Validate token integrity after migration
- [ ] Test against timing attacks

## Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] All existing tokens can be decrypted
- [ ] New tokens use latest key version
- [ ] Migration process tested with >1000 tokens
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Handoff to Phase 3

Upon completion, Phase 3 will add CLI commands to trigger and manage key rotation operations from the command line.
