# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the Google Drive MCP Server project.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of multiple workflows designed to ensure code quality, security, performance, and reliable deployments:

- **Continuous Integration** (`ci.yml`) - Core testing and quality checks
- **Code Quality Analysis** (`code-quality.yml`) - Advanced code analysis and metrics
- **Security Scanning** (`security-scanning.yml`) - Comprehensive security audits

```

### Branch Protection
Recommended branch protection rules for `main`:
- Require status checks: All CI workflow jobs
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require review from code owners
- Restrict pushes to administrators and maintainers

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Pull Request Workflow:**
   - Create feature branch from `main`
   - Make changes and push to feature branch
   - CI workflows run automatically on PR creation
   - Address any failing checks before requesting review
   - Review automated reports and performance comparisons

2. **Release Process:**
   - Merge approved PRs to `main`
   - Create release using semantic versioning
   - Release workflow handles package building and publishing
   - Monitor deployment workflows for successful rollout

### For DevOps/SRE

1. **Monitoring:**
   - Review deployment monitoring reports
   - Set up alert integrations (Slack, email, etc.)
   - Monitor performance trends and capacity planning

2. **Security:**
   - Review security scan reports weekly
   - Update security scanning tools and configurations
   - Respond to vulnerability alerts promptly

3. **Infrastructure:**
   - Maintain deployment targets and configurations
   - Update environment variables and secrets
   - Review and optimize workflow performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CI Failures:**
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Verify test environment setup
   - Review ESLint configuration updates

2. **Deployment Issues:**
   - Verify environment secrets and variables
   - Check Docker image build logs
   - Review health check configurations

3. **Security Scan Failures:**
   - Update vulnerable dependencies
   - Review and whitelist false positives
   - Check secret scanning patterns

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting repository variables:
- `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG=true`
- `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG=true`

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review dependency update PRs
- **Monthly**: Update workflow action versions
- **Quarterly**: Review and optimize performance budgets
- **Annually**: Security audit of entire pipeline

### Updates
When updating workflows:
1. Test changes in feature branch
2. Use workflow dispatch for manual testing
3. Document changes in PR descriptions
4. Update this documentation as needed

## Contributing

When contributing to the CI/CD pipeline:
1. Follow existing patterns and conventions
2. Add comprehensive comments to complex workflows
3. Test changes thoroughly before merging
4. Update documentation for new features or changes
5. Consider backward compatibility and migration paths
